	<P>In parsing the name into its component parts, if the name contains a
	comma or the "F" flag is passed, STDNAME^XLFNAME looks for suffixes immediately
	to the left of the first comma, and at the very end of the name. The suffixes
	it recognizes are 1ST through 10TH, JR, SR, DR, MD, ESQ, DDS, RN, ARNP, DO, 
	PA, and Roman
	numerals I through X.<br>
	<br>
	(<b>NOTE:</b> The ARNP, DO, and PA suffixes were added with Kernel Patch 
	XU*8.0*535.)</P>
<P>If a name part before any recognizable suffixes is more
	than one character in length, and contains no vowel or 'Y', it is also assumed
	to be a suffix. The Name Standardization looks for the DR suffix immediately
	after the first comma, and for any suffix between two commas immediately after
	the Family Name. The portion of the name to the left of the comma, less any
	suffixes, is assumed to be the Family Name.</P>
<P>After STDNAME^XLFNAME
	accounts for all Suffixes, it looks at the portion of the name after the comma.
	It assumes that the first space-delimited piece is the Given Name. If any other
	pieces are left, the last one (rightmost) is assumed to be the Middle Name, and
	anything else is appended to the end of the Given Name.</P>
<P>If the name
	contains no comma, and the "F" flag is not passed, STDNAME^XLFNAME looks for
	suffixes at the very end of the name. The last space-delimited piece before any
	suffixes is assumed to be the Family Name. The first space-delimited piece is
	assumed to be the Given Name. If any other pieces are left, the last one
	(rightmost) is assumed to be the Middle Name, and anything else is appended to
	the end of the Given Name.</P> 
	<H4><A NAME="example">Example</A></H4> 
	<P>In this example, the MYNAME variable is set to the name to be
	standardized. The "C" flag indicates that the name components should be
	returned in the MYNAME array, and the "P" flag indicates that parenthetical
	text should be removed from the name. STDNAME^XLFNAME sets MYAUD to original
	name passed in and sets nodes in the MYAUD array to flag changes and possible
	problems.</P>
